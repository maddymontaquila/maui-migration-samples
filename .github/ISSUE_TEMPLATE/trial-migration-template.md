[ ] It built, but the layout/UI is all messed up
[ ] I have no idea what happened, please help!!!

**Share some details on your migration.** Feel free to add screenshots/before + afters, video walkthroughs, blogs, or angry rants. Particularly - what .csproj properties did you get rid of and what could you keep? What code changes did you have to make in your C# and XAML? 

**What NuGets do you have that don't work for MAUI yet?**

### Custom Renderers (optional)
