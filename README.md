# Welcome!
We want to make it as simple as possible for Xamarin developers to evolve their apps to [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui). This repo is an experimental place for folks to share their migration stories, tips and tricks, blockers, and more. We will use these examples to help us develop [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant) support.

# Help us by participating
To help the MAUI team, open an issue using the included template. Then, let us know how your migration went. What steps did you take? Do you have before/after screenshots? Were you successful?! We'll be active in the comments to chat about your experience and figure out ways to improve it!

# Migration Steps
Currently, the best guide for migrating your app is on the [.NET MAUI Wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Migrating-from-Xamarin.Forms-(Preview)). Additionally, if you have custom renderers or are a library maintainer, [Javier Suarez Ruiz's](https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/mvpsummit2022-dotnet-maui) repo is super useful ([this one](https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/xamarin-forms-to-net-maui) is too.

Follow these steps, take some notes, and let us know what does and doesn't work. Try this with your Xamarin.Forms apps, Xamarin native apps, libraries, packaged custom controls, and more!
